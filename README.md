An Instagram clone built with Swift and SwiftUI for iOS. This app replicates the core features of Instagram, including user authentication, photo uploads, and social interactions like likes and comments. It's a great project to showcase iOS development skills and learn about app architecture, Firebase integration, and UI design with SwiftUI.
